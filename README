This library can be used to parse an IFR route into a series of waypoints using a navdata database.
It has two modes of operation: attended and unattended. In attended mode, any ambiguous tokens in
the route will be queried (i.e., a list of possibilites will be given, which can be shown to the
user for manual selection). In unattended mode a best guess will be made to the intended route.

Download the navdata from the X-Plane website [1] and place the data files in the navdata folder.
